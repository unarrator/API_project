This part of the project is entirely done by BT18CSE105.

Here I have used yfinance api to make this stock price app.

Along with that streamlit module is used to deploy the app.

so before starting the project we will have to download these 2 modules by -

pip install streamlit
pip install yfinance

I have used a style.css file for styling this app.

This app takes name of the stock from user and upon pressing a 'GO' button it will primarily show DAILY CLOSING PRICE
and DAILY VOLUME for that stocks.

There is a option called 'Display Additional Information'. If we add additional information like 'Stock Actions'
and 'Quarterly Financials' is added the results will be shown also.

To run the web app the command is

streamlit run web_app_v3.py
